# Overview

The scripts in this repository were used to create the figures in [Riback, Katanski et al. Cell 2017](http://drummondlab.org/papers/paper/adaptive-phase-separation)

The `src` (source code) directory contains two directories:
1. `evolution` contains alignment and sequence-analysis scripts, mostly [Python](http://python.org) and [R](http://r-project.org).
2. `biophysics` contains circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and small-angle X-ray scattering scripts in [Mathematica](http://mathematica.com) format.

The `data` directory contains protein-sequence files used in the evolutionary analysis.

README files are contained in each directory further describing the scripts.
